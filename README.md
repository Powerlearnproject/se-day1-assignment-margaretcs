#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. 
importance: Ensures that the software products are user friendly, reliable, efficient and meets the needs of the customers.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  a.  Manual Coding Era (1940s–1950s): Software was manually written in machine language, directly interacting with hardware under severe limitations.
 b.   Introduction of High-Level Languages (1950s–1960s): Languages like FORTRAN and COBOL made programming more efficient and human-readable.
   c.  Structured Programming (1960s–1970s): Structured approaches using control structures like loops and conditionals improved program clarity and maintainability.
  d.   Software Engineering Conference (1968): The NATO conference formally introduced the term "software engineering" to address rising development challenges.
 e.   Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): OOP promoted modularity and code reuse through concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  f.  Agile Methodologies (1990s–2000s): Agile shifted development to iterative cycles, emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and continuous delivery.
  g.  DevOps and CI/CD (2010s): DevOps integrated development and operations, automating software delivery pipelines for faster, more reliable releases.
  h.  Cloud-Native and AI-Driven Development (2020s): Cloud computing and AI tools now enable scalable, intelligent, and on-demand software solutions.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Identifying the scope, purpose, and feasibility of the project while defining objectives and resources.
Requirements Analysis: Gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.
Design: Creating detailed technical specifications, including architecture, data flow, and interfaces.
Implementation (Coding): Writing and developing the actual code based on design documents.
Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended and meets quality standards by identifying and fixing bugs.
Deployment: Releasing the software for use, either as a complete package or through phased rollouts.
Maintenance: Continuously updating and improving the software to address issues or adapt to changing needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: This is a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase (like planning, design, development, testing) is completed before moving to the next. It works well for projects with clear, fixed requirements and minimal changes. Example: Building a bridge or developing software for a medical device where strict regulations and documentation are required.
Agile: This is a flexible, iterative approach where work is done in small cycles (called sprints), allowing for frequent adjustments based on feedback. It’s ideal for projects with evolving requirements. Example: Developing a mobile app where user needs and features may change during the process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: They’re the builders of the team, writing the code that brings ideas to life. Developers create, fix, and improve software to make sure it works smoothly and does what it’s supposed to.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Think of them as the detectives—they test the software, hunt for bugs, and make sure everything runs perfectly before it’s released. They’re all about keeping the quality top-notch.
Project Manager (PM): The organizer-in-chief, they keep the team on track by managing deadlines, budgets, and communication. They’re the ones making sure everyone’s on the same page and that the project gets delivered without a hitch.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): They are like a toolbox for coding. Everything you need e.g editor, debugger, and are all in one place. Example: Visual Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): They help teams keep track of changes in code and work together smoothly. You can also go back to an older version if something breaks. Example: Git or SVN.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tech changes fast: It's hard to keep up with new tools and languages. Fix: Learn regularly through courses or online resources.
Deadlines get tight: There’s pressure to finish quickly without sacrificing quality. Fix: Break work into small steps and prioritize.
Bug hunting: Finding and fixing errors can be frustrating. Fix: Use debugging tools and work with teammates.
Changing plans: Requirements sometimes shift during the project. Fix: Keep good communication with stakeholders and adapt.
Teamwork troubles: Miscommunication can cause delays. Fix: Use tools like Slack and hold frequent meetings.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or modules of the software to ensure they work correctly in isolation. It helps catch bugs early and saves time and money.
Integration Testing: Checks if different modules or components work together as expected. It ensures smooth communication between parts of the system.
System Testing: Evaluates the entire application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. It ensures the software is ready for deployment.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets the end-user or client’s expectations and requirements. It’s the final check before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective input prompts to guide AI models toward producing desired outputs.
importance: enhances efficiency, improves output quality, enables complex task handling and controls AI behavior.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Explain science."
Improved Prompt: "Summarize how photosynthesis works in plants. Include key steps."
Why the improved prompt is better:
It has a clear topic: photosynthesis.
It asks for specific information: key steps.
It is direct and brief.
